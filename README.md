## 🧠 Things I Built Completely Myself

These are areas where **I wrote every line** — no hand-holding:

- ✅ Entire **frontend UI** — every component, every animation, every responsive layout
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** design system — amber/stone palette, rounded-square avatars, warm editorial aesthetic
- ✅ All **Mongoose schemas** — User, Posts, Comment, Likes, CommentLike, Payment, Notification
- ✅ **Razorpay webhook** integration and payment verification logic
- ✅ **Cloudinary** upload flows — posts, profile pics, banners
- ✅ **NextAuth** configuration with session callbacks and JWT
- ✅ **Navbar scroll behavior** — hide on scroll down, show on scroll up, page-specific logic
- ✅ **PRO badge** unlock/revoke logic with post count tracking
- ✅ **Comment reply system** — threading, lazy loading, pagination
- ✅ **Mobile sidebar drawer** — bottom navbar with notification drawer

## 🤝 Where I Used Claude (AI-Assisted)

I used Claude as a **debugging and architecture partner** — not to write code for me, but to talk through problems I was stuck on:

- 🔧 Diagnosing **stale closure bugs** in scroll-based pagination
- 🔧 Fixing **duplicate comment renders** on infinite scroll
- 🔧 Understanding **React Context** provider tree — why context was undefined in layout
- 🔧 **Optimistic UI patterns** — how to show temp posts before server confirms
- 🔧 Designing the **Notification schema** and where to create notifications in existing actions
- 🔧 **Race condition** in `deletePost` — `findById` after `findByIdAndDelete`
- 🔧 Why `showPost` reset was **reverting local like/comment state** on re-render

Every fix was understood, adapted, and integrated by me. Claude was the rubber duck that actually talked back.

## 🎯 What I Learned

This was my **first Next.js project** — and I went deep:

- How **Server Actions** work vs API routes
- **App Router** mental model — server vs client components
- Managing **complex state** across deeply nested components
- Building **real payment flows** with webhooks
- Designing **scalable MongoDB schemas** for social features
- Debugging **race conditions** and **stale closures** in React
- **Optimistic UI** — making apps feel fast before server responds

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Built with ☕, late nights, and a lot of "why is this not working."  
Special thanks to the chai that kept me going.
